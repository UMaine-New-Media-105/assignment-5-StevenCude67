Assignment 5: Simulation Game
__________________________________________________________________________________________

Assignment 5.1: For this assignment we had to create 5 "bubbles" using classes and objects.
the 5 bubbls have to move randomly around the screen and start in a random X and Y location. 
I had to refrence the two videos that we had to watch this week to understand how to actually
set this up. I had troubles getting it to work once I typed it all out. Eventually, I figured
it out and made 5 teal circles, that I plan to make planets in later assignments!
