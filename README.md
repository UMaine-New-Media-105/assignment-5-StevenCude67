Assignment 5: Simulation Game
__________________________________________________________________________________________

Assignment 5.1: For this assignment we had to create 5 "bubbles" using classes and objects.
the 5 bubbls have to move randomly around the screen and start in a random X and Y location. 
I had to refrence the two videos that we had to watch this week to understand how to actually
set this up. I had troubles getting it to work once I typed it all out. Eventually, I figured
it out and made 5 teal circles, that I plan to make planets in later assignments!

Assignment 5.2: For this assignment we had to take the 5 "bubbles" from the previous assig-
ment and make 50 instead. We couldn't just copy and paste the same code 50 times because
that would take way to long and thier are more fficent way to do it. That would b to use
loops and arrays. I was really struggling with this one for a bit, because I didn't underst-
and how to use arrays correctly. I had to refrence the video we were given and follow along
to finally undertsand how to make this work. i eventually got it to work perfectly and messed
around with the parimeters for a bit, before I made 50 red dots that start in random locations.
