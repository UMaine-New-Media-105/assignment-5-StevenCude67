Assignment 5: Simulation Game
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Assignment 5.1: For this assignment we had to create 5 "bubbles" using classes and objects.
the 5 bubbls have to move randomly around the screen and start in a random X and Y location. 
I had to refrence the two videos that we had to watch this week to understand how to actually
set this up. I had troubles getting it to work once I typed it all out. Eventually, I figured
it out and made 5 teal circles, that I plan to make planets in later assignments!

Assignment 5.2: For this assignment we had to take the 5 "bubbles" from the previous assig-
ment and make 50 instead. We couldn't just copy and paste the same code 50 times because
that would take way to long and thier are more fficent way to do it. That would b to use
loops and arrays. I was really struggling with this one for a bit, because I didn't underst-
and how to use arrays correctly. I had to refrence the video we were given and follow along
to finally undertsand how to make this work. i eventually got it to work perfectly and messed
around with the parimeters for a bit, before I made 50 red dots that start in random locations.

Assignment 5.3: For this assignment I had to take the shifting bubbles and turn them into
a custom sprite/class. I also had to make a bredder and catcher for my simulation. I made
my simulation a weird version of Pac-Man where Pac-Men chase a bunch of different ghost, who
are bredding. I wanted to make it special so I decided to make the bubbles in the background
items from the actual game. I made Cherries, Oranges, Melons, and Keys! I put them in the main
sketch fil, but it got cluttered really quickly, so I made two seperate .js files for the items
and another for the characters. I then had a hard time figuring out how to make the simulation
work how I was supposed to. I ended up following the tutorial by Jon. I had a decent time foll-
owing the tutorials. At one point the webiste crashed and I had to re-do alot of work, which was
annoying. Then later the ghosts would move really fast and it took my awhile to figure out why. 
I didn't close a loop in the draw() so it would apply values to the addX that weren't there.
When I was don I was happ with what I had so far.

Assignment 5.4: For this assignment I had to take the already made simulation make the breeders,
well breed. I had to make it so they didn't over populate to quickly. I followed the tutorial
for this one as well. I didn't have much trouble with this one. I made the breeders breed pretty
quickly and made the simulation finish quickly. I also created a function to make it easier to
apply the distance function for the catchers. I only included the SKETCH.js file for this one
since I didn't change anything for the other ones.

Assignment 5.5: For this assignment I had to take the already made simulation and make it so
the catchers would eat the ghosts. THis was the easies out of the last 3 parts of this assign-
ment. I simply followed the tutorial and applied the proper code to Pac-man. I used the function
I made in assignment 5.4 and applied it to Pac-man. I also made Pac-Man slowly turn white if he
doesn't eat a ghost for awhile. I attempted to make him open and close his mouthh, but I couldn't
figure it out, so I dropped it. I included SKETCH.js and CHARACTERS.js because I made some changes
to the former file. Overall, this assignment was difficult to complete, but was very satisfiying 
and awesome to see the final result!!
